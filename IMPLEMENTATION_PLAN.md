# Worksite Management Studio - Implementation Plan

## ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Tier Implementation

### 1. Data Population
- [x] Set up Faker library for Go
- [x] Create data generation scripts for each entity
- [x] Implement batch insertion logic
- [x] Generate and insert 100,000+ entries for each related table
- [x] Verify data integrity after population

### 2. Performance Optimization
- [x] Analyze current query performance
- [x] Identify complex statistical queries to optimize
- [x] Implement database indices for frequently queried fields
- [x] Optimize JOIN operations
- [x] Implement query caching where appropriate
- [x] Add database connection pooling

### 3. Performance Testing
- [x] Set up JMeter test environment
- [x] Create test scenarios for:
  - [x] Normal load
  - [x] Peak load
  - [x] Stress testing
- [x] Implement performance monitoring
- [x] Document performance metrics
- [x] Create performance test reports
