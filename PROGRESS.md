## Next Steps
1. Begin Gold Tier implementation:
   - Design user authentication system
   - Implement user registration and login
   - Add JWT token authentication

2. Implement role-based access control:
   - Define user roles and permissions
   - Create role validation middleware
   - Set up admin-specific functionality

## Notes
- Silver Tier completed successfully!
- Database has been populated with 100,000+ records for each entity
- Performance optimizations have shown significant improvements in response times
- JMeter tests show the system can handle high load with appropriate response times
- Ready to proceed with Gold Tier implementation
