## Notes
- Silver Tier completed successfully!
- Database has been populated with 100,000+ records for each entity
- Performance optimizations have shown significant improvements in response times
- JMeter tests show the system can handle high load with appropriate response times
- Authentication system with JWT has been implemented
- Role-based access control is in place with user and admin roles
